### File Transfer Drill
***

This small file transfer program I created checks a source folder for files that were last modified after t-24hrs, and automatically moves them to a destination folder.
For example you execute this program on Monday at 3pm, it will check for files that have a last modified date stamp between Sunday at 3pm and Monday at 3pm.

##### Instructions
WINDOWS ONLY

* Download the File24hrcheck.cs, and open it.
* In the "FileCheck" class, change the "src" string with your source folder location,
* In the "processFile" method, change the "dest" string with your destination folder location.

* Compile and execute program.
