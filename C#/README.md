### C# Projects.
***

A collection of small C# projects I've tackled.

Browse each project for more information on each of them.
C# is more widely used in conjunction with Windows OS. I originally used windows and Visual Studio 2015 to get into it, but I'm more inclined to use linux whenever possible. I learned most of my C# using the latest development of the .NET Core framework as well as VS Code as a cross platform environment for developing chtml .NET applications. Fortunately, those tools are open source on github, making it easy to learn and access. Each project readme lists the installing instructions and links to resources.
