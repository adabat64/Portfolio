#.NET Core - First Test Console Application

I built this small console app to test the .NET Core Framework on Mac.
This app (so far) presents a small menu with 2 working options: viewing a database that logs Blog names and their URLs, and adding a new Blog to the database.
The app is built using the latest installment of the .NET Core CLI and Framework, SQLite, and uses EFCore.

##### Instructions
Mac only, VS Code, EF Core.
* Download the "ConsoleTestEF" folder and cd into it
* Enter the following commands: "dotnet restore", then "dotnet run".
* Follow the menu options.

The app has not yet been compiled and executed on Windows OS, but works successfully on Mac OS X.
