### Landon Hotel

This project is a tutorial series on Lynda.com designed to teach you [JavaScript](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Web-Designers-2016-Q3-REVISION/461841-2.html).
Starting from a blank JavaScript file, the point of this tutorial is to add features to a pre-existing website, such as the time, window timers,  

Js I learned and wrote:
* Adding the time in javascript and formatting it.
* Using window timers to update the javascript features without reloading page.
* Formatting the time by changing the separator class in HTML every other second.
* Tutorial challenge: Write in the date above the time written as 'Saturday, June 28'. Used both switch and array list.
