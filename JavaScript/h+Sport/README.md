This project is a tutorial series on Lynda.com designed to teach you [JavaScript](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Web-Designers-2016-Q3-REVISION/461841-2.html).
Starting from a blank JavaScript file, the point of this tutorial is to collect  user input and create and event that estimates the total sales, including the shipping costs from different forms on the index. The HTML and CSS are already written.
