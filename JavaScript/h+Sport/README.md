### H+ Sport

This project is a tutorial series on Lynda.com designed to teach you [JavaScript](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Web-Designers-2016-Q3-REVISION/461841-2.html).
Starting from a blank JavaScript file, the point of this tutorial is to collect  user input and create and event that estimates the total sales, including the shipping costs from different forms on the index. The HTML and CSS are already written.

Js I learned and wrote:
* Adding event listeners on DOM load, disabling and activating buttons based on user input, adding alerts for missing information.
* Adding a price calculation estimate based on different items quantities, State tax, and shipping costs, and using innerHTML to write calculation details, in an e-commerce context.
* Extra challenge from tutorial - added new store in Seattle and a new product. Added to both HTML, and JS
