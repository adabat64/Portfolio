### Library Management Database
***

In this exercise I had to create a database management system for a library.
I wrote it using Microsoft SQL Server 2012. The PDF included here lists how to create databases, tables, how to populate the tables, how to perform certain queries including several types of joins, and finally how to create stored procedures

Download SQL Server 2012 and follow along the PDF to learn and recreate the LMS.
