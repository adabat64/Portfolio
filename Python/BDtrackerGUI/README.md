### BD Tracker GUI

I created this app to keep track of the French/Belgian comics I own, hence the title BD, short for Bande Dessin√©e.
The simple GUI allows one to add a BD by it's title, author, and publisher, as well as any issues owned. You can also delete BD and issues separately.

The BD are saved in a local SQLite database (SQLite 3).

##### Instructions
Pre-reqs: Python3 and Phoenix

* Download the folder and cd into it.
* Start Python3
* Type exec(open("BDGUI.py").read())

* ##### To quit the app use cmd+Q. ######
