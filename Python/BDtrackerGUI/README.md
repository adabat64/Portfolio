### BD Tracker GUI

I created this app to keep track of the French/Belgian comics I own, hence the title BD, short for Bande Dessin√©e.
The simple GUI allows one to add a BD by it's title, author, and publisher, as well as any issues owned. You can also delete BD and issues separately.

The comics are saved in a local SQLite database (SQLite 3).
