### Python Projects
***

A collection of small Python projects I've completed.
Since I am more of a linux user, I've written those python projects for Macs, using Python 2+ or 3+.
GUIs using the wx modules are built with wxPhoenix for Python 3+ on Mac.

Some of these projects were completed during my time at [The Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com) in Portland, OR. Click on the link for more information about the software development bootcamp.
